    <h1>Neighborhood Watch - A Strategy Game </h1>
    <p class="limited-width">The graph below is a stylized friendly neighborhood. Lines are roads and dots are intersections.</p>
    <p class="limited-width">To best protect this friendly neighborhood from enemy attack (e.g., zombies), the goal is to place 4 strike teams (select 4 dots) to minimize the average distance between the strike teams and all other points. 
        Green dots are safe and red dots are in danger. Make as many dots as green as possible.
    </p>
    <p class="limited-width">The score below is the average distance between your operators and the other intersections. The lower the score, the better.</p>
